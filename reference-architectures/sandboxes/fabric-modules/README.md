# Fabric Modules

The modules included in this folder are source from the
Cloud Foundation Fabric and are vendored for stability of the project.

## Modifications

All modules use here have had the required version of Terraform update to
`required_version = "= 1.5.7"` so that Infrastructure Manager can be used to
execute the Terraform.
