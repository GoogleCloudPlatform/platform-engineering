# Cloud Deploy Operations Function

This project contains a Google Cloud Run Function written in Go, designed to
interact with Google Cloud Deploy. The function listens for deployment events on
a Pub/Sub topic, processes those events, and triggers specific deployment
operations based on the event details. For instance, when a deployment release
succeeds, it triggers a rollout creation and sends the relevant command to
another Pub/Sub topic.

## Usage Note

This code is designed to integrate with the Terraform configuration for the
[cloud_deploy_flow](../../README.md) demo. While you can deploy this component
individually, it's primarily intended to be used as part of the full
Terraform-managed workflow. Please note that this section of the readme may be
less actively maintained, as the preferred deployment method relies on the
Terraform setup.

## Requirements

- Go 1.20 or later
- Google Cloud SDK
- Google Cloud Pub/Sub
- Google Cloud Deploy API
- Set environment variables for Google Cloud project configuration

## Environment Variables

The function relies on environment variables to specify project configuration.
Ensure these are set before deploying the function:

| Variable Name | Description                           | Required |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `PROJECTID`   | Google Cloud project ID               | Yes      |
| `LOCATION`    | The deployment location (region)      | Yes      |
| `SENDTOPICID` | Pub/Sub topic ID for sending commands | Yes      |

## Structure

### Main Components

- **config**: Stores the environment configuration necessary for the function.
- **PubsubMessage**: Structure representing a message from Pub/Sub, with `Data`
  payload and `Attributes` metadata.
- **OperationsData**: Metadata that describes deployment action and resource
  details.
- **CommandMessage**: Structure for deployment commands, like `CreateRollout`.
- **cloudDeployOperations**: Main Cloud Run Function triggered by a deployment
  event, processes release successes to initiate rollouts.
- **sendCommandPubSub**: Publishes a `CommandMessage` to a specified Pub/Sub
  topic, which triggers deployment operations.

## Function Workflow

1.  **Trigger**: The function `cloudDeployOperations` is triggered by a
    deployment event, specifically a CloudEvent.
2.  **Event Parsing**: The function parses the event data into a `Message`
    struct, checking for deployment success events.
3.  **Rollout Creation**: If a release success is detected, it creates a
    `CommandMessage` for a rollout and calls `sendCommandPubSub`.
4.  **Command Publish**: The `sendCommandPubSub` function publishes the
    `CommandMessage` to a designated Pub/Sub topic to initiate the rollout.

## Setup and Deployment

### Local Development

1.  Clone the repository and set up your local environment with the necessary
    environment variables.
2.  Run the Cloud Run Functions framework locally to test the function:

```bash
functions-framework --target=cloudDeployOperations
```

### Deployment to Google Cloud Run Functions

1.  Set up your Google Cloud environment and enable the necessary APIs:

    ```bash
    gcloud services enable cloudfunctions.googleapis.com pubsub.googleapis.com
    clouddeploy.googleapis.com
    ```

2.  Deploy the function to Google Cloud:

    ```bash
    gcloud functions deploy cloudDeployOperations \
       --runtime go120 \
       --trigger-topic <YOUR_TRIGGER_TOPIC> \
       --set-env-vars PROJECTID=<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>,LOCATION=<YOUR_LOCATION>,SENDTOPICID=<YOUR_SEND_TOPIC_ID>
    ```

## Error Handling

- If message parsing fails, the function logs an error but acknowledges the
  message to prevent retries.
- Command failures are logged, and the function acknowledges the message to
  prevent reprocessing of erroneous commands.

### Notes

- For production environments, consider validating that the `TargetId` within
  `CommandMessage` is dynamically populated based on actual Pub/Sub message
  data.
- The function relies on `pubsub.NewClient` which should be carefully monitored
  in production for connection management.
