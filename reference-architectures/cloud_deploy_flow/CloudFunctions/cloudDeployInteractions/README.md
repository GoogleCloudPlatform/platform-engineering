# Cloud Deploy Interactions with Pub/Sub

This project demonstrates a Google Cloud Run Function to manage deployments by
creating releases, rollouts, or approving rollouts based on incoming Pub/Sub
messages. The function leverages Google Cloud Deploy and listens for
deployment-related commands sent via Pub/Sub, executing appropriate actions
based on the command type.

## Usage Note

This code is designed to integrate with the Terraform configuration for the
[cloud_deploy_flow](../../README.md) demo. While you can deploy this component
individually, it's primarily intended to be used as part of the full
Terraform-managed workflow. Please note that this section of the readme may be
less actively maintained, as the preferred deployment method relies on the
Terraform setup.

## Features

- Listens for Pub/Sub messages with deployment commands (CreateRelease,
  CreateRollout, ApproveRollout) Messages should include protobuf request.

- Initiates Google Cloud Deploy actions based on the received command.

- Logs each step of the deployment process for better traceability.

## Setup

### Requirements

- Go 1.16 or later
- Google Cloud SDK
- Access to Google Cloud Deploy and Pub/Sub

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-folder>
    ```

2.  **Set up Google Cloud**: Ensure you have enabled the Google Cloud Deploy and
    Pub/Sub APIs in your project.

3.  **Deploy the Function**: Deploy the function using Google Cloud SDK:

    ```bash
    gcloud functions deploy cloudDeployInteractions --runtime go116 \
    --trigger-event-type google.cloud.pubsub.topic.v1.messagePublished \
    --trigger-resource YOUR_TOPIC_NAME
    ```

### Pub/Sub Message Format

The Pub/Sub message should include a JSON payload with a `command` field
specifying the type of deployment action to execute. Examples of the command
types include:

- `CreateRelease`: Creates a new release for deployment.
- `CreateRollout`: Initiates a rollout of the release.
- `ApproveRollout`: Approves a pending rollout.

### Sample Pub/Sub Message

The message should follow this structure:

```json
{
  "message": {
    "data": "<base64-encoded JSON containing command data>"
  }
}
```

The JSON inside `data` should follow the format for `DeployCommand`:

```json
{
  "command": "CreateRelease",
  "createReleaseRequest": {
    // Release creation parameters
  },
  "createRolloutRequest": {
    // Rollout creation parameters
  },
  "approveRolloutRequest": {
    // Rollout approval parameters
  }
}
```

## Code Structure

- **DeployCommand struct**: Defines the command to be executed and the
  parameters for each deploy action (create release, create rollout, or approve
  rollout).

- **cloudDeployInteractions function**: Main function triggered by Pub/Sub
  messages. It parses the message and calls the respective deployment function
  based on the command.

- **cdCreateRelease**: Creates a release in Google Cloud Deploy.
- **cdCreateRollout**: Initiates a rollout for a specified release.
- **cdApproveRollout**: Approves an existing rollout.

## Logging

Each function logs key steps, from initialization to message handling and
completion of deployments, helping in troubleshooting and monitoring.
