# Example Cloud Run Function

This project demonstrates a Google Cloud Run Function that triggers deployments
based on Pub/Sub messages. The function listens for build notifications from
Google Cloud Build and initiates a release in Google Cloud Deploy when a build
succeeds.

## Usage Note

This code is designed to integrate with the Terraform configuration for the
[cloud_deploy_flow](../../README.md) demo. While you can deploy this component
individually, it's primarily intended to be used as part of the full
Terraform-managed workflow. Please note that this section of the readme may be
less actively maintained, as the preferred deployment method relies on the
Terraform setup.

## Prerequisites

- Go version 1.15 or later
- Google Cloud account
- Google Cloud SDK installed and configured
- Necessary permissions for Cloud Build and Cloud Deploy

## Environment Variables

The function relies on environment variables to specify project configuration.
Ensure these are set before deploying the function:

| Variable Name | Description                                        | Required |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `PROJECTID`   | Google Cloud project ID                            | Yes      |
| `LOCATION`    | The deployment location (region)                   | Yes      |
| `PIPELINE`    | The name of the delivery pipeline in Cloud Deploy. | Yes      |
| `TRIGGER`     | The ID of the build trigger in Cloud Build.        | Yes      |
| `SENDTOPICID` | Pub/Sub topic ID for sending commands              | Yes      |

## Function Overview

The `deployTrigger` function is invoked by Pub/Sub events. Here's a breakdown of
its key components:

1.  **Initialization**:

    - Loads environment variables into a configuration struct.
    - Registers the function to be triggered by CloudEvents.

2.  **Message Handling**:

    - Parses incoming Pub/Sub messages.
    - Validates build notifications based on specified criteria (trigger ID and
      build status).

3.  **Release Creation**:

    - Extracts relevant image information from the build notification.
    - Constructs a `CreateReleaseRequest` for Cloud Deploy.
    - Sends the request to the specified Pub/Sub topic.

4.  **Random ID Generation**:

    - Generates a unique release ID to ensure each deployment is distinct.

## Deploying the Function

To deploy the function, follow these steps:

1.  Ensure that your Google Cloud SDK is authenticated and configured with the
    correct project.
2.  Use the following command to deploy the function:

```bash
gcloud functions deploy deployTrigger \
    --runtime go113 \
    --trigger-topic YOUR_TOPIC_NAME \
    --env-file .env
```
