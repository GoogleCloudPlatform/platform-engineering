# Pub/Sub Local Demo

This project is a simple demonstration of a Pub/Sub system using Google Cloud
Pub/Sub and a basic Express.js server. It is designed to visually understand how
messages are sent to and from Pub/Sub queues. The code provided is primarily for
demonstration purposes and is not intended for production use.

## Features

- **Real-time Message Display**: Messages from various Pub/Sub subscriptions are
  fetched and displayed in a web interface.
- **Clear Messages**: Users can clear all displayed messages from the UI.
- **Send Messages**: Users can send messages to the Pub/Sub topic via the input
  area.

## Project Structure

- **public/index.html**: The main HTML file that provides the structure for the
  web interface.
- **public/script.js**: Contains JavaScript logic for fetching messages, sending
  new messages, and clearing messages.
- **public/styles.css**: Contains styling for the web interface to ensure a
  clean and responsive layout.
- **index.js**: The main server file that handles Pub/Sub operations and serves
  static files.

## Installation

1. Install the required dependencies:

    npm install

2. Create a `.env` file and populate it with the environment variables found in
   `.env.sample`

3. Start the server:

    node index.js

4. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` to access the demo.

## Usage
