Regardless of the tool you use, passwords stored should be further secured. When using Secret Manager, following are some of the ways you can further secure your secrets:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Limiting access : The secrets should be                          readable writable only through                          the Service Accounts via IAM roles.

Secret Manager    encrypts the secret at rest using AES-256 by default. But you can use your    own encryption keys, customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) to encrypt your secret    at rest. For details, see    Enable customer-managed encryption keys for Secret Manager.</p> </li> <li> <p>Password rotation : The passwords stored in the secret manager should be    rotated on a regular basis to reduce the risk of a security incident.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"reference-architectures/automated-password-rotation/#why-password-rotation","title":"Why password rotation","text":"<p>Security best practices require us to regularly rotate the passwords in our stack.

First, you saw a generic reference architecture that can be used to automate password rotation in any password management system. In the later section, you saw an example deployment that uses Google Cloud services to rotate password of Cloud Sql database in Google Cloud Secret Manager.</p> <p>Implementing an automatic flow to rotate passwords takes away manual overhead and provide seamless way to tighten your password security. It is recommended to create an automation flow that runs on a regular schedule but can also be easily triggered manually when needed. There can be many variations of this architecture that can be adopted. For example, you can directly trigger a Cloud Run Function from a Google Cloud Scheduler job without sending a message to pub/sub if you don't want to broadcast the password rotation. You should identify a flow that fits your organization requirements and modify the reference architecture to implement it.</p>"},{"location":"reference-architectures/backstage/","title":"Backstage on Google Cloud","text":"<p>A collection of resources related to utilizing Backstage on Google Cloud.</p>"},{"location":"reference-architectures/backstage/#backstage-plugins-for-google-cloud","title":"Backstage Plugins for Google Cloud","text":"<p>A repository for various plugins can be found here -&gt; google-cloud-backstage-plugins</p>"},{"location":"reference-architectures/backstage/#backstage-quickstart","title":"Backstage Quickstart","text":"<p>This is an example deployment of Backstage on Google Cloud with various Google Cloud services providing the infrastructure.</p>"},{"location":"reference-architectures/backstage/backstage-quickstart/","title":"Backstage on Google Cloud Quickstart","text":"<p>This quick-start deployment guide can be used to set up an environment to familiarize yourself with the architecture and get an understanding of the concepts related to hosting Backstage on Google Cloud.</p> <p>NOTE: This environment is not intended to be a long lived environment.

One of the critical components in this field is the automation of application deployments, which streamlines the entire process from development to production.</p> <p>Most organizations have predefined rules around security, privacy, deployment, and change management to ensure consistency and compliance across environments. These rules often include automated security scans, privacy checks, and controlled release protocols that track all changes in both production and pre-production environments.</p> <p>In this demo, the architecture is designed to show how a deployment tool like Cloud Deploy can integrate smoothly into such workflows, supporting both automation and oversight. The process starts with release validation, ensuring that only compliant builds reach the release stage. Rollout approvals then offer flexibility, allowing teams to implement either manual checks or automated responses depending on specific requirements.</p> <p>This setup provides a blueprint for organizations to streamline deployment cycles while maintaining robust governance. By using this demo, you can see how these components work together, from container build through deployment, in a way that minimizes disruption to existing processes and aligns with typical organizational change management practices.</p> <p>This demo showcases a complete workflow that begins with the build of a container and progresses through various stages, ultimately resulting in the deployment of a new application.</p>"},{"location":"reference-architectures/cloud_deploy_flow/#overview-of-the-demo","title":"Overview of the Demo","text":"<p>This demo illustrates the end-to-end deployment process, starting from the container build phase.
