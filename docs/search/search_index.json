It is recommended to create an automation flow that runs on a regular schedule but can also be easily triggered manually when needed. There can be many variations of this architecture that can be adopted. For example, you can directly trigger a Cloud Run Function from a Google Cloud Scheduler job without sending a message to pub/sub if you don't want to broadcast the password rotation.

One of the critical components in this field is the automation of application deployments, which streamlines the entire process from development to production.</p> <p>Most organizations have predefined rules around security, privacy, deployment, and change management to ensure consistency and compliance across environments. These rules often include automated security scans, privacy checks, and controlled release protocols that track all changes in both production and pre-production environments.</p> <p>In this demo, the architecture is designed to show how a deployment tool like Cloud Deploy can integrate smoothly into such workflows, supporting both automation and oversight. The process starts with release validation, ensuring that only compliant builds reach the release stage. Rollout approvals then offer flexibility, allowing teams to implement either manual checks or automated responses depending on specific requirements.</p> <p>This setup provides a blueprint for organizations to streamline deployment cycles while maintaining robust governance. By using this demo, you can see how these components work together, from container build through deployment, in a way that minimizes disruption to existing processes and aligns with typical organizational change management practices.</p> <p>This demo showcases a complete workflow that begins with the build of a container and progresses through various stages, ultimately resulting in the deployment of a new application.</p>"},{"location":"reference-architectures/cloud_deploy_flow/#overview-of-the-demo","title":"Overview of the Demo","text":"<p>This demo illustrates the end-to-end deployment process, starting from the container build phase.

Once the release     is created, a notification is dispatched to the Pub/Sub Operations topic.</p> </li> <li> <p>Rollout Process: Another Cloud Function picks up this notification and     initiates the rollout process by sending a <code>createRolloutRequest</code> to the     \"Command Queue.\"</p> </li> <li> <p>Approval Process: Since rollouts typically require approval, a     notification is sent to the <code>cloud-deploy-approvals</code> Pub/Sub queue.
